## Setup
Each Player will take control of a Faction in the setting. You may either choose one of the premade Factions or make your own, including assigning your Faction's Stats. Once you are done creating your Faction, you may pick any hex on the map to be your starting location with each hexes attributes defined by their marker on the map. Conflicting starting locations will be arbitrated by the Referee.

## Events
At the end of Round 1 and every 2 Rounds after, the Referee will roll an Event which will affect the World. These Events will affect all Players or specified hexes.

## Relics
Relics are ancient, powerful items that are scattered around the game world but are hidden to the Players. If you settle a hex containing a relic, you will gain +1 to a Stat and +1 to the number of Stat points you get each turn. Relocating a Relic from the hex holding it takes an action but allows you to place it in any hex you control. If you lose control of the hex containing the Relic, you also lose control of the Relic.

Some relics will have a special action associated with them. Typically, using a relic will have a big long-lasting effect, such as destroying a hex, but will permanently destroy the relic.

## Secret Mission
After you create your Faction but before Round 1, you will be assigned a Secret Mission by the Referee. Each Mission is unique for each Player.

If you accomplish your Mission before the end of Round 10 and your Faction is not destroyed, you will be rewarded 5 points that contribute towards your score.

## Stats
- **Start:** You start with 5 points you can put into any Stat
- **Each turn:** Gain 1 point you can put into any Stat
##### Stats
| Stat        | Starting Level | Description                       | 
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| Territory   | 1              | number of holdings                |
| Resources   | 1              | money, wealth, items              |
| Defence     | 1              | fortifications, internal stability|
| Manpower    | 1              | armies, firepower                 |
| Intel       | 0              | spies, subterfuge                 |

If any one of your stats reaches a negative value, you must immediately spend an amount of any number of Stats to increase the stat to a minimum of zero.

If all your Stats drop to 0, your Faction is destroyed and you can no longer gain points. The Referee may assign you a new Faction as a part of an Event or you can negotiate with another Player to lend you Territory or Resources. You will be considered a vassal of that Player and half your score will transfer to them at the end of Round 10 unless you are liberated.

## Actions
Players get *two* actions each Round which are submitted to the Referee in writing. Conflicting actions are resolved by contested **d10 + relevant Stat** rolls. 

Players may freely discuss their actions and negotiate with each other at the table without costing an action. This means a Player may tell the table one thing, but submit a different action to the Referee.

Actions resolve in the following order: Home Actions → Subterfuge Actions → Diplomacy Actions → Offensive Actions → Other Actions

### Home actions
- **Improve a Stat by +1:** Explain to the Referee what you wish to do to increase one of your Stats. Some examples: colonise a hex [+1 Territory], build a mine [+1 Resources], conscript soldiers [+1 Manpower], hire spies [+1 Intel]. You can only take this action once per Round.
- **Trade a Stat:** Explain to the Referee what you do that allows you to Trade up to 3 points of one Stat for an equal amount of another, such as buying mercenaries [+1 Manpower, -1 Resources]. You cannot Trade Intel for any other Stat but can turn other Stats into Intel.
- **Root Out Spies:** Make an Intel roll with a DC = number of enemy Spies in your realm. Lose 1 Intel. If you succeed, you are alerted which Players have spies in your realm and d6+Intel Spies (newest first) are captured.
- **Go on High Alert:** Spend an amount of Intel. All Players attempting subterfuge against you suffer a penalty to their rolls equal to the amount of Intel spent and do not gain the Spy bonus to rolls against you until the end of the next Round.
- **Discover Plots:** Lose 1 Intel. Pick a Player. If they have attempted subterfuge on you in the past round and have no Spies in your realm, you are aware of what actions they did. If they did not commit any subversive acts against you, lose 1 Defence or Resources (their choice). If they did and have at least one Spy, they lose one Spy in your realm and act as if they are innocent.
- **Research:** Spend an amount of Resources and roll a d10 check with a bonus equal to the Resources spent on this action. If you roll a [10 + number of relics in your possession] or higher, you gain a custom Relic. The DC of this roll decreases by 1 at the end of each Round you spend at least one action to attempt Research. If you lose your research through any means, including completing a Research project, the DC resets to [10 + number of relics in your possession]. Once you complete your Research, you may choose which hex you own holds the Relic. You can only take this action once per turn.

### Offensive actions
- **Invade:** Spend an amount of Manpower targetting a number of hexes equal to your Manpower score. Roll a d10 check with a bonus equal to the Manpower spent on this action versus a specific Player's Defence roll. If you win, lose 1/2 Manpower spent and take the targetted hex and 1 Resources from the other Player. If you lose, lose [Manpower spent] Manpower. If two Players Invade each other on the same turn, both sides lose 1/2 Manpower spent and no territory is gained.
- **Train Troops:** Gain an amount of temporary Manpower or Defence equal to 1/2 your Territory until the end of the next Round. You cannot use this action again until the end of the second next Round.

### Subterfuge actions
**Spy:** Roll an Intel check versus a specific Player's Defence roll. Lose 1 Intel. If you roll higher than their Defence value, you now have a Spy in their territory. You get +1 per number of Spies in their territory to all d10 rolls made against this Player until you are discovered and have a [number of Spies] in 4 (on a d4) chance of knowing any future action they take.

If you fail, the other Player catches your Spy and interrogates. The other Player rolls 1d6: On a 1-2, they learn nothing useful. On a 3-5, they learn who sent the Spy. On a 6, they learn who sent the Spy and the Spy also tells them about other acts of subterfuge you are attempting on them.

If you have at least one Spy in a Player's realm, you may take one of the following actions:
- **Assess Risk:** Roll an Intel check versus a specific Player's Defence roll. Lose 1 Intel. If you roll higher than their Defence score, you learn one of the following: The Player's highest AND lowest Stat OR one Stat of your choice.
- **Gather Intel:** Gain an amount of Intel equal to the number of your Spies active in one Player of your choice's realm. This action can only be taken once per round.
- **Incite Rebellion:** Roll an Intel check versus a specific Player's Defence roll. Lose 1 Intel. If you roll higher than their Defence value, they lose 1 Defence or 1 Intel (your choice). If you fail, the Player is alerted to your subterfuge attempt.
- **Steal:** Roll an Intel check versus a specific Player's Defence roll. Lose 1 Intel. If you roll higher than their Defence score, you gain 1 Resources and they lose 1 Resources. Instead of Resources, you may choose to steal an item, research, or a Relic item you know the Player has. If you fail, the Player is alerted to your subterfuge attempt and you lose one Spy in their realm.

**Explore a Hex:** The first time you use this action once per Round, it does not cost an Action to use. Lose 1 Intel. You explore a honeycomb (one hex and all six adjacent hexes) will give you the following details for each hex that makes up the group:
- Who owns this hex
- The terrain, history, and other fluff associated with the hex
- Which Region the hex belongs in
- If the targetted hex (not the entire honeycomb) is unowned, you know if a Relic is located inside the hex

### Diplomacy actions
**Trade:** Two Players make an agreement to trade Intel (such as revealing known/owned hexes), Stats or a Relic with each other. For example, one side may sell Territory for Resources or a Relic for Resources. The trade does not need to be equal but both Players must agree on the Trade and commit their action to the Trade. If one side does not spend their action on the Trade, the Trade falls through. A contract may be signed to decide what happens if one side defaults on their end of the Trade, and all contracts are enforced by the Referee.

However, one or more sides can instead choose to Steal the Trade. If you succeed a d10 Contested roll, you gain the bonuses the other party offered you without losing what you promised them. You may spend a Stat (such as Manpower to take by force or Intel to steal) to gain a +1 bonus to the roll. If either side is suspicious of the other, they may spend an amount of Manpower to accompany the Trade, giving a Defence bonus equal to the Manpower spent if the other side tries to Steal the Trade. If both sides decide to Steal the Trade, a fight breaks out between any troops sent, both sides are alerted to the others' plans, and no gains are made. For more details, see: **Invade**.

### Improv actions
If you want to do something that does not fit any of these predetermined actions, you may propose in improv action to the Referee. It is up to the Referee to determine if the action is doable and any checks needed to attempt the action.

## The End
The final Round is Round 10, at the end of which the scores will be tallied. The Player with the highest score (total of all Stats + number of Relics added together) gets to describe a final Event or scene in the game world before the Braunstein section of the game (Prologue) concludes. If they decline, the Referee will instead describe a scene tying the events of the game together.

The Players will then be asked where in the game world they would like to start the character-driven part of the game.
